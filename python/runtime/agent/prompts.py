"""Prompt templates for Apple Zero agent orchestration.

The templates draw inspiration from public prompt collections (for example the
``system-prompts-and-models-of-ai-tools`` repository) but are condensed for the
runtime.  :class:`PromptManager` composes these snippets with persona and safety
overrides on demand.
