# Troubleshooting and FAQ
Apple Zero is an AI agent framework based on the open-source project Agent Zero. This page addresses frequently asked questions and provides troubleshooting steps for common issues encountered while using Apple Zero.

## Frequently Asked Questions
**1. How do I ask Apple Zero to work directly on my files or directories?**
- Place the files inside the project directory or use the file browser in the UI to navigate to them.

**2. When I input something in the chat, nothing happens. What's wrong?**
- Check if you have set up API keys in the Settings page. Without keys the application cannot access language models.

**3. How do I integrate open-source models with Apple Zero?**
- Refer to the [Installing and Using Ollama](installation.md#installing-and-using-ollama-local-models) section for configuring local models via Ollama or LMÂ Studio.

**4. How can I make Apple Zero retain memory between sessions?**
- Use the backup tab in Settings to export your data before updating and restore it afterwards.

**5. Where can I find more documentation or tutorials?**
- Visit the project's GitHub repository for discussions and guides.

**6. My `code_execution` tool doesn't work, what's wrong?**
- Ensure the required system packages are installed and that `python` is available in your environment. Re-run `./setup.sh` if needed.

## Troubleshooting

**Installation**
- Re-run the setup script to ensure all dependencies are installed: `./setup.sh`.
- Verify your Python version is supported.

**Usage**
- Check the `logs/` directory for detailed error messages.
- Ensure API keys are valid and not rate-limited.

**Performance Issues**
- Large prompts or heavy tool usage may slow responses. Consider using faster models or reducing context size.
